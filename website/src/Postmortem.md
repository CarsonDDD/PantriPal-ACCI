## Development Reflection

When looking back on iteration 0 of the project, Things stayed relatively the same in terms of overall
goals. Expectedly, we were unable to finish all of the features we had planned at the start, However 
we were able to complete most of the core features.

One important thing we learned from this development was how important it was to discuss our schedules.
At the start of every iteration, we discussed the weeks where we would be busy and where we might have 
more free time. From this, we were able to plan out the amount of work we could do and also have an idea 
of when certain things would be finished. This communication helped all members understand the state of 
the project and helped us plan the applications development.
