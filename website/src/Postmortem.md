# Postmortem

Included in this page is a reflection of our overall project, what went well and what didn't, and a discussion on our development experience.

## Development Issues

When starting development, we had some issues with merge conflicts and conflicting branches. This 
was because we didn't strictly adhere to the git flow branching strategy. Because of this, we had to 
resolve some difficult conflicts. After this issue, we began to be more strict about adhering to the 
git flow branching strategy and did not encounter any similar problems.

A unique issue that our group faced was the addition of a new team member late in iteration 3. This
required us to onboard a new member and we found it to be more difficult than expected. Onboarding requires
lots of communication and our group stumbled with explaining our framework and general development process.
This made it difficult for the new member to understand the project and how to contribute. Once we realized
that onboarding would take more effort, we were able to put that effort in and successfully introduce the
new member to our project.

## Development Reflection

When looking back on iteration 0 of the project, Things stayed relatively the same in terms of overall
goals. Expectedly, we were unable to finish all of the features we had planned at the start, However 
we were able to complete most of the core features.

One important thing we learned from this development was how important it was to discuss our schedules.
At the start of later iterations, we discussed the weeks where we would be busy and where we might have 
more free time. From this, we were able to plan out the amount of work we could do and also have an idea 
of when certain things would be finished. This communication helped all members understand the state of 
the project and helped us plan the applications development.

In our Iteration 2 retrospective, we noted that we had difficulty with communication. The paragraph 
above is one way that we were able to effectively communicate. In addition to this, we met more regularly
and more frequently, so when someone had problems they were able to discuss them with the group.
