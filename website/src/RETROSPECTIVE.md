# Retrospective

When looking back on iteration 2, we noticed some difficulty with communication. This made us less effective
than we would have hoped. This can be improved by having more in depth planning on who is working on 
what. Once we have a good idea of who is doing what, we can meet more often to discuss the problems we
are facing. Another thing we can do is have well-defined goals for each member. Having well-defined goals
means each member understands what is needed from them and this will stop us from doing work twice.

We can evaluate our ability to communicate concretely by looking at the number of times we meet per week.
By messaging each other or messaging the group chat at least once per week, we can ensure that the team
acts more cohesively. Another way to evaluate our communication is to ask each group member to rate 
themselves and others on their ability to communicate, and discuss our results and why we feel that way.
This will give us a better understanding of each group member and will improve the teams communication.
